I have implemented framework with following for this test.
	- Cucumber (separate package)
	- TestNG(separate package)
	- Generating log file using log4
	- Generting HTML report

As per my experience, application is not working properly
Once I select the product_1 and added the same in the Cart. Then I am moving to Home page and select product_2 and add the same in the cart, it display only product_2. 
I have implemented delete cart functionality but commented the code to cover other functionality required for the test. Due to time constraint , I have not developed 2 separate scenario.

I have used following folder structure for this framework.
